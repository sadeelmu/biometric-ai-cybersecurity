# biometric-ai-cybersecurity
This project demonstrates a simple computer vision facial recognition system for cybersecurity authentication using TensorFlow and Keras. The project uses the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset for training a MobileNetV2 model to recognize and authenticate users based on their facial features.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a basic AI-powered facial recognition system for enhancing cybersecurity measures. The system uses computer vision and AI to authenticate users based on their facial images.
